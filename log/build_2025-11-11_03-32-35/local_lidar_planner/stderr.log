[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgo2_sport_api.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "go2_sport_api", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "go2_sport_api"
  with any of the following names:

    go2_sport_apiConfig.cmake
    go2_sport_api-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "go2_sport_api" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "go2_sport_api_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "go2_sport_api" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
